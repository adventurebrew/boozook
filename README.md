# Text extraction
* To extract Text of an Script use this comnmand:
* python -m boozook.text path/to/game/directory (after that in boozook's directory an new folder called text creates that contains 2 files, cat.tsv is for object names, and tot.tsv for the text of the dialouge)
* To recompress now the modified text back into an STK use this command.
* python -m boozook.text /path/to/game/directory -r (after that you have an folder called an texts)
